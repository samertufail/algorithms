# algorithms
This is my go at various algorithmic challenges from the CTCI and leetcode.com OJ. My primary reasons to do this are:
- To keep my skills fresh and get to explore new features offered by C++11/14 
- Improve on existing knoweldge and find new ways to solve similar problems
- Gear up towards more formal programming competitions
- Serve as a sample for my style;approach & skills

The source codes are my personal implementation (without external help in most cases) of all the problems in the best of the ability that I could solve them.

Each source file comes with the question, one or more solutions and possible test cases.
